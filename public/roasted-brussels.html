   <h1>Ingredients</h1> 
<p>For the Brussels Sprouts
2 cups (176 g) shaved or sliced Brussels sprouts
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper or use gochugaru flakes, or use both
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
For the Walnut Crumble
1/2 cup (58.5 g) raw walnuts
1 tablespoon sun dried tomato
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
For the rest of the Salad
3 to 4 cups (120 g) fresh spring greens or other baby greens of choice
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes halved
For the Dressing
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano or 1 teaspoon fresh
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder or 1 small clove of minced garlic
vegan parmesan, chopped fresh basil or parsley for Garnish
Instructions
Roast the Brussels sprouts.
Preheat the oven to 420° F ( 215° C).
Slice or shave the Brussels sprouts, if you haven’t already, and then add to a bowl. Add the oil and maple syrup, and toss well to coat. Then, mix all the spices and herbs in a small bowl and sprinkle them all over the Brussels sprouts. Toss well again, and then spread that evenly onto a parchment lined baking sheet.
Bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Check in at the 13 minute mark and move the Brussels sprouts around, so that they bake evenly. Check after another 3-4 mins. Remove them from the oven once most of the sprouts are crispy on the edges.
Meanwhile, make the walnut crumble.
Add the walnuts to a food processor and process until they’re a coarse meal. Add the sun-dried tomato, garlic, and salt, and pulse again to mix into a coarse meal. Depending on the moisture content and oil content in the sun dried tomatoes, you might need to add a teaspoon or so of olive oil for the mixture to be more like a crumble and not too dry.
Transfer the mixture to a small baking dish, then add them to the oven for the last minute of the baking time for the Brussels sprouts. Switch off the oven when you remove the Brussels sprouts, but let let the walnut mixture sit in the hot oven for 3-4 minutes to just warm up and for flavors to meld, and then take that dish out of the oven.
Assemble the salad.
Slice your cherry tomatoes, if you haven't already, and add that along with the greens to a bowl.
Add the roasted Brussels sprouts to the bowl and top it with the walnut crumble.
Make the dressing by mixing all of the dressing ingredients until well combined, then drizzle that all over the Brussels sprouts salad. You can also add some fresh herbs, like some torn basil or parsley, and then toss lightly and serve the salad. Garnish with vegan parmesan (optional)</p>
