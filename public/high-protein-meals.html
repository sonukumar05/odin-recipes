        It’s actually a common misconception that you can’t get ample protein on a vegan diet, but there are definitely cases when you need more protein than the average person. If you are looking for some easy, one-pot, high protein vegan meals, look no further!
        
        These easy dinner recipes have something for everyone from soups and stews to salads, burgers, curry, even lasagna! And there’s a whole section of Instant Pot meals for quick and easy, hands-off cooking.
        
        
        The meals here all get at least 25% of their calories from protein, and some are as high as 40% protein or more!
        
        For most meals if you have a good amount of mix of beans, tofu, tempeh, seitan, grains, nuts and seeds, then there’s generally enough protein for the average person. You can amp up protein in your everyday meals by using the following tips and not have to think about it!
        
        — Use multiple sources, beans, lentils, whole grains, seeds, nuts in the meal. For eg. Add some lentils or quinoa to your chickpea/bean stew or bean burger. Add some cooked chickpeas or toasted nuts or cooked bulgur to your lentil curry! Blend up tofu in the cream or sauce.
        — Think of the sides. For eg, serve with whole grain, whole wheat flatbreads or bread, or chickpea flour or almond flour flatbreads. Mix some quinoa in your rice!</p>
